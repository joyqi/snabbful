# Snabbful

Snabbful is a simple, fast, and flexible library for building user interfaces by using [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom).
We add a state management layer on top of Snabbdom, and we provide a simple API for building user interfaces.

## Why Snabbful?

Actually, the reason why I created Snabbful is personal.
I'm a backend developer, and I'm used to render HTML pages on the server side.
It's too complicated for me to build user interfaces in personal projects by separating the frontend and backend,
and I'm also tired of using Webpack to build the frontend.
These challenging scenes remind me of the days when I had jQuery.
